        <p>Konidela Pawan Kalyan (born Konidela Kalyan Babu; 2 September 1968 or 1971[n 1]) is an Indian actor, politician, filmmaker, martial artist, and philanthropist who primarily works in Telugu cinema. Known for his unique acting style and mannerisms, he has a large fan base and a cult following. One of the highest-paid actors of Indian cinema, he has featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2013 and is the recipient of a Filmfare Award, a SIIMA Award, a CineMAA Award, and a Santosham Film Award.

    <p>As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout South America and was radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease he witnessed.His burgeoning desire to help overturn what he saw as the capitalist exploitation of Latin America by the United States prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Árbenz, whose eventual CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of the United Fruit Company solidified Guevara's political ideology. Later in Mexico City, Guevara met Raúl and Fidel Castro, joined their 26th of July Movement, and sailed to Cuba aboard the yacht Granma with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents, was promoted to second-in-command, and played a pivotal role in the two-year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.</p>
